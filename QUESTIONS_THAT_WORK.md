## ⚠️ Questions That May Work (May Timeout with Gemini)

These questions should work but might be slower due to Gemini API timeouts:
- Most lecture/presentation questions (unless they're in the first few slides)
- Detailed questions about specific slides
- Questions about images/charts in presentations (OCR may not have captured all content)

## 📝 Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - Instead of "grades", ask "What is the grading scale?"
2. **Use keywords** - Questions with "grading scale", "materials", "policy" work best
3. **Course questions first** - Syllabus/schedule questions are most reliable
4. **Content questions** - Lecture questions work but may be slower
5. **Simple phrasing** - Direct questions work better than complex ones
